Final Project Proposal

For the final project, I wanted to work with the Spotify API. My idea is to allow the user to input any artist and display
some visualization of the data from every album and single of this artist. This visualization could be the number of tracks
over time or the average popularity, acousticness, energy, liveness, tempo, etc over time. After looking through the
documenatation, I think the Spotipy library could be useful to get access to the data offered by Spotify. I would probably
use Pandas to create the dataset and make it ready for use for the visualization. In terms of visualization, I plan on using
some combination of Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. I also plan on using Flask for the simple web dev required.

I am still thinking about what exactly to display and how to make it look pleasant and cool on the frontend.
